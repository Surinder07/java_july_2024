OOPS 
1. Inheritance 

# 
class B inherits from class A 

Single inheritance
A  - Parent class/ Super Class / Base Class 
|
B   Child class / Sub class / Derived class /


Multi level inheriatnce 

A 
|
B
|
C




Multiple Inheritance is not supported in Java directory 


## Problem 

Class Vehicle {
   model ,make, color, year

public void printDetails(){
model ,make, color, year
}

}

                                vehicle 
        |                        |                          |   
    Car [bodytype]            Bike[Passenger cap]          Truck [loadCapacity ]
printCarDetails()               printBikeDetails()          printTruckDetails()
create Object of Car class and call its method...
Bike 
Truck 





## this 
## super 


A ---- x  , this.x
 
B ---- super.x 

## Object 

Every class has a super class called Object class 

user defined class 
Java created 


## Has-A relationship

Car has a Engine  -

Employee is a address 
Employee has a address
