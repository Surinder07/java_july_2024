## Recap 
1. abstract classes 
2. abstraction 


Multi level inheritance 
A
|
B
|
C


                      
           Multiple inheritance      
            B       C
                |
                A


## Interface 

interface is a contract which a class have to fulfill if it inherit from that interface.

  interface A {



}

class B implements A {


}



1. 100 % abstraction 
2. Loose coupling ...
3. Multiple inheritance 

when 1 class does not depend on another 


## Problem statement 

                        


        // void takePictures();                  
        Camera   MusicPlayer    Telephone  Calcualtor  Computer  [Interface]
            |           |           |           |           |           |

                                    Iphone  [C]





// default methods 
// static methods 




## Packages 
group of similar kind of classes/interfaces... 

two classes with same name 
helps to identify classes 

com.test.Test
com.demo.Test



Two types 
1. User defined packages 

one we created ... 


2. Inbuilt packages.... 

already provided by Java 



    Java 

lang, util, sql
